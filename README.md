# cf-ex1-portfolio

## Description

My portfolio was builded as a simple HTML and CSS static page, with the goal of a light, fast and responsive web site.

## How to run the project

Open the projects main folder in your terminal and run the command:

- npm run start (for localhost at: "http://localhost:1234")

Or use the public [https://myflix-gkm.netlify.app/](https://myflix-gkm.netlify.app/) address on your browser

## Project dependencies

To easy the comunication with who may be interest on my work, I create a short Javascript logic to send messages direct to my email box. To complete this logic, a Google cloud service was used.

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Google Cloud Service
