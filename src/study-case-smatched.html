              <p>
                Smatched is a monetization product for games where users earn
                points by watching ads (e.g., video ads). Game owners can then
                generate revenue through these ads. The product aims to provide
                a seamless integration for developers to monetize their games
                while offering users rewards for engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                This company didn’t reach a public launch, but it was the first
                time I felt I truly owned my contributions as a developer. The
                project allowed me to have hands on React framework in many
                levels, by applying react-router, react-text-truncateand
                react-helmet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Later I decided to have this piece of work as a starter for my
                own projects, which I named initialy as

              <h2>Approach & Technical Decisions</h2>
              <p>
                Since the developers team was composed by interns, the manager
                initially opted for a static-site approach with the unanime
                choice of language framework to be
                <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank"> React</a>(a modern
                Javascript library). The decision of the language was lovely,
                but it sound confusing for some coaleagues and me knowing that
                React main creation reason was with the purpose of reusability
                of Components. The explanation was the priority of having a page
                to present for potential clients and investors. After that, he
                assigned each intern to one specific page with the goal to move
                the project faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the Blog page was assigned for me, I saw very earlier the
                huge potential of a full-functionaly feature. After talked to
                the manager, and we decided priorities together, I was fueld
                motivated to make my page work with React components in the same
                time he was expecting a static page. This decision would not
                only ensure the full functionallity to be ready for show, but
                would ensure a scalable and reusable design system for the
                pages, making it easier for the publication of the next articles
                to come.

              <h2>Page Functionality & Architecture</h2>
              <h3>All Articles Page</h3>
              <p>
                The blog homepage was designed to display all articles in a card
                layout. I created a BlogCard component that accepted props for
                the image, title, snippet, and metadata. Each card was reusable
                and allowed the page to dynamically render content from the
                article data array using
                <a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map"
                  target="_blank"
                  >.map()</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                To improve usability, especially as the number of articles grew,
                I implemented Pagination Component. This involved slicing the
                array of articles based on the current page and the number of
                items per page, then updating the state when the user navigated
                between pages. This was a practical introduction to stateful UI
                logic and performance-aware rendering.

              <h3>Individual Article Page</h3>
              <p>
                Routing users to individual articles posed a new challenge.
                Instead of hardcoding routes for each blog post, I chose to use
                a query parameter-based routing system. For example, navigating
                to "/article?name=exploringofferwall" would dynamically load the
                blog post that matched the name parameter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inside the Article component, I used
                <a
                  href="https://reactrouter.com/api/hooks/useLocation#uselocation"
                  target="_blank"
                  >React Router’s useLocation()
                </a>
                hook to read the query string and parsed it with
                URLSearchParams. This allowed me to extract the article name and
                match it to the correct article object in the content data
                structure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rendering the content required a flexible system, since each
                article could contain a unique mix of content types. I solved
                this by, inside of the Article component, add a
                <a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch"
                  target="_blank"
                  >Switch block’s type
                </a>
                that will rendered the appropriate layout—whether it was a text
                paragraph, a list, an image, or a quote. This helped me learn
                how to build scalable UI systems that adapt to data rather than
                rely on rigid layout code.

              <h2>Key Learnings and Challenges</h2>
              <p>
                One of the most challenging aspects of this project was
                implementing dynamic routing and understanding how client-side
                navigation works in React. I had to dive deep into how the
                browser handles URLs and how React Router translates those into
                renderable views. During this process, I reached out to more
                experienced developers who explained how routing trees and query
                strings could work together, which helped me better structure my
                solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another key learning moment came when the CTO of the project
                raised concerns about performance. I hadn’t initially considered
                things like lazy loading, content shift, or font preloading.
                After researching and studying Google’s Core Web Vitals, I made
                several improvements: optimizing image sizes, lazy-loading hero
                sections, restructuring HTML for better content flow, and
                reducing unused CSS. This not only improved my technical
                understanding of front-end performance but also helped me see
                how critical performance is to user experience and SEO.
