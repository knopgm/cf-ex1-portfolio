              <p>
                Smatched is a monetization product for games where users earn
                points by watching ads (e.g., video ads). Game owners can then
                generate revenue through these ads. The product aims to provide
                a seamless integration for developers to monetize their games
                while offering users rewards for engagement.

                This company didn’t reach a public launch, but it was the first
                time I felt I truly owned my contributions as a developer. The
                project allowed me to have hands on React framework in many
                levels, by applying react-router, react-text-truncateand
                react-helmet.

                Later I decided to have this piece of work as a starter for my
                own projects, which I named initialy as

                  >BlogMe Articles </a

                for the assurance of connection between each functionality
                piece.

              <h2>Approach & Technical Decisions</h2>
              <p>
                Since the developers team was composed by interns, the manager
                initially opted for a static-site approach with the unanime
                choice of language framework to be
                <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank"> React</a>. The
                decision of the language was lovely, but it sound confusing for
                me and some coaleagues as React main creation reason is the r
                eusability of Components. The explanation was the priority of
                having a page to present for potential clients and investors.
                After that, he assigned each intern to one specific page with
                the goal to move the project faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the Blog page was assigned for me, I saw very earlier the
                huge potential of a full-functionaly feature. After talked to
                the manager, and we decided priorities together, I was fueld
                motivated to make my page work with React components in the same
                time he was expecting a static page. This decision would not
                only ensure the full functionallity to be ready for show, but
                would ensure a scalable and reusable design system for the
                pages, making it easier for the publication of the next articles
                to come.

                Changing gears to the user’s point of view, the web page was
                developed with
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> (a

                  >React-Redux</a
                >
                (a state manager to guarantee consistent behaviour across server
                and client logic). Bootstrap (a Javascript styling library) was
                also used with some of its pre-built components.

                more information about the movie like synopis, genre and
                director; a separate genre and director views; and the user's

              <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>
                Working with react is my goal, so I was excited to build this
                app from the beginning. The struggles were most related to the
                backend since it has a new way to work and debug, but I coop
                with that with the same natural procedure steps: google search
                for documentation for new frameworks and libraries, google
                search for specific issues, console logging when it was
                possible, including debugging function, and asking for help when
                none of the firsts could solve my problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next steps for this app will be a better styling tool or
                intensive Bootstrap learning, to improve visual aspects and a
                more friendly user experience, although all the chosen tools
                were a great selection from the course.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another important lesson is to save more time to reach the
                expectations of the schedule.
