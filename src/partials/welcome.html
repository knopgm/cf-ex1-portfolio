          <p>
            My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I first
            worked in an IT company environment as a trainee in Business
            administration.
            <br />
            At that time, I could just imagine the fun job my colleges have, but
            in 2019 I had the opportunity to do some online trial of programming
            courses, and finally experienced the emotions of interacting with
            internet creations. <br />
            Since then, I am still learning, practising and studying a lot to
            change my career path.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm looking for working with a team, where I can help improve the
            company's products while learning and strengthening my skills.
