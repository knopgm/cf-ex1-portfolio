          <p>
            My interest in web development started when I worked in a few IT
            companies as a trainee in Business administration...
            <br />
            ...In 2019 I had the opportunity to do some online trials of
            programming courses, and finally experienced the emotions of
            internet creation.
            <br />
            Since then, I am still learning, practising and studying to change
            my career path.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last year, I concluded a Full Stack course at Career Foundry and now
            I'm looking to work with a team, where I can apply and improve my
            skills while contributing to awesome User Experience results.
