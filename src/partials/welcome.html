          <p>
            Iâ€™m a Web Developer with a business administration background.
            <br />
            As a business administrative assistant in IT companies, my role
            included a variety of communication with many different stakeholders
            and suppliers. <br />
            These experiences not only improved my powerful communication,
            organization and problem-solving mindset skills but inspired me with
            the interactive results of coding and all related to their projects
            and daily routine.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to keep growing and improving my knowledge while working
            with great individuals, projects and companies that are responsive
            and user-experience-focused.
